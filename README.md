# Data-Extraction-using-API

# About
This is a project of extracting data using APIs by `requests` library. 
### Aim: 
* To practice different HTTP request
* To learn extracting values/data from complex lists and nested dictionaries
* To understand reading the documention of an API.

## I. Transport For London data extraction.ipynb
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_for_London), "Transport for London (TfL) is a local government body responsible for most of the transport network in London, England.

TfL has responsibility for various rail networks including the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway, as well as London's buses, taxis, principal road routes, cycling provision, trams and river services. It does not control all National Rail services in London, although it is responsible for London Overground and TfL Rail services." 

They have an API that allows user interact with their services and work with their data, which I did so to answer the find answer to the following **Tasks**:
#### 1. Parse the dictionary and print the AirQuality predictions for tomorrow
#### 2. What are the different modes of transport which are operated by Transfer for London? How many of modes do they have?
#### 3. How many BikePoints in London are operated by Transfor for London? How many docks are in all BikePoints? There is the information for empty and full docks for each BikePoint.
#### 4. How many tube and bus lines are in London? Print names of all tube lines.
#### 5. How many station has victoria line?
#### 6. Plan the journey from Heathrow Airport to Tower Bridge using Public Transport, Taxi or Bike?

## II. TheMovieDB data extraction.ipynb
"[The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/about) is a community built movie and TV database. Every piece of data has been added by our amazing community dating back to 2008. TMDb's strong international focus and breadth of data is largely unmatched and something we're incredibly proud of. Put simply, we live and breathe community and that's precisely what makes us different."

They have an API that allows user interact with their services and work with their data, which I did so to answer the find answer to the following **Tasks**:

#### 4. Find top 5 trending:
* movies
* tv-shows

# Challenges/What I learnt
I didn't face any challenges. But I learnt working with APIs and using `request` library. Using `JSON` helped me when learning more about data extraction from `json`, `xml`, and `html`.
